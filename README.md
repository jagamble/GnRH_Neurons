# GnRH_Neurons
The files in this repository describes work carried out in the Neuroendocrinology Laboratory of the Babraham Institute, between March 2000 and December 2002.  This work provided the first documented evidence of a role for the Eph/ephrin gene family in the migration of GnRH neurons during embryonic development in the mouse.

This is a poster that was presented at the Society for Neurosciences meeting in San Diego, November 2001.  It described the work up to that point.

**EBI_Talk_V2.ppt**
This is a lab talk I gave to the European Bioinformatics Institute in March 2005.  It describes all the work that had just been published in the J. Neurosci. paper, together with some further investigations I made later on.

The work was published as:\
Gamble JA, Karunadasa DK, Pape J-R, Skynner MJ, Todman MG, Bicknell RJ, Allen JP and Herbison AE. (2005). Disruption of ephrin signalling associates with disordered axophilic migration of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons.  J. Neurosci. 25(12): 3142-3150.  doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4759-04.2005
